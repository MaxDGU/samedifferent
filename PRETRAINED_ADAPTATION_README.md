# Pretrained Model Adaptation Efficiency Test

This experiment tests the **correct** hypothesis about meta-learning adaptation efficiency by using **pretrained meta-learning models** rather than trying to train from scratch.

## 🎯 Hypothesis
**Second-Order MAML adapts faster to new tasks than First-Order MAML** when both start from the same pretrained meta-learning weights.

## 🔄 Why This Approach is Correct

### ❌ Previous Approach (Wrong)
- Train models from scratch during the experiment
- Models never learned the meta-learning objective properly
- Both methods stayed at chance level (50%)
- Measured "adaptation" of untrained models = meaningless

### ✅ New Approach (Correct)
- Load **pretrained meta-learning models** that already learned to adapt
- Both methods start from the **same pretrained weights**
- Measure how quickly each adapts to **new test episodes**
- This is the proper meta-learning evaluation protocol

## 📊 What This Measures

### Test-Time Adaptation Efficiency
For each pretrained model (seeds 42-46):
1. **Load pretrained meta-learning weights**
2. **Create FOMAML and Second-Order MAML wrappers** with the same weights
3. **Test adaptation on held-out episodes** (regular, lines, open tasks)
4. **Measure accuracy vs adaptation steps** for each method
5. **Average results across all 5 seeds** for statistical significance

### Metrics Tracked
- **Accuracy curve**: Accuracy at each adaptation step (0-20 steps)
- **Steps to target**: How many steps to reach 55%, 60%, 65%, 70% accuracy
- **Adaptation time**: Time per adaptation step
- **Final accuracy**: Final accuracy after 20 adaptation steps

## 🚀 How to Run on Della

### Step 1: Submit the Job
```bash
# SSH to Della and navigate to project
cd /scratch/gpfs/mg7411/samedifferent

# Submit SLURM job
sbatch run_pretrained_adaptation_efficiency.slurm
```

### Step 2: Monitor Progress
```bash
# Check job status
squeue -u mg7411

# Watch output (replace JOBID with actual job ID)
tail -f results/pretrained_adaptation_efficiency/slurm_output_JOBID.out
```

## 📁 Pretrained Model Paths

The script automatically loads from:
```
/scratch/gpfs/mg7411/samedifferent/results/meta_baselines/conv6/seed_{42,43,44,45,46}/best_model.pt
```

These are the **conv6 architecture models** that were meta-trained on all PB tasks and achieved good performance.

## ⚙️ Experiment Parameters

**Test Configuration**:
- **Seeds tested**: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 (5 seeds for statistical significance)
- **Test episodes per seed**: 100 
- **Max adaptation steps**: 20
- **Target accuracies**: 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%
- **Inner learning rate**: 0.01 (for adaptation)

**Tasks tested**: `['regular', 'lines', 'open']` (subset for efficiency)

**Expected Runtime**: ~1-2 hours (much faster than training from scratch!)

## 📈 Expected Results

If the hypothesis is correct:

**FOMAML (First-Order)**:
- Starts from same pretrained weights
- Should require **more adaptation steps** to reach target accuracies
- Example: Needs 8-12 steps to reach 70%

**Second-Order MAML**:
- Starts from same pretrained weights  
- Should require **fewer adaptation steps** to reach target accuracies
- Example: Needs 3-6 steps to reach 70%

## 📁 Output Files

The experiment creates:
- `results/pretrained_adaptation_efficiency/pretrained_adaptation_results.json` - Raw data
- `results/pretrained_adaptation_efficiency/adaptation_summary.txt` - Human-readable summary
- `results/pretrained_adaptation_efficiency/pretrained_adaptation_efficiency.png` - Comparison plots

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If models fail to load**:
- Check that pretrained model paths exist on Della
- Verify the models use the correct conv6 architecture
- Check SLURM error logs for specific loading errors

**If adaptation shows no improvement**:
- This would suggest the pretrained models aren't actually meta-trained
- Check the pretrained model accuracy on meta-validation tasks
- Verify the models achieved >60% accuracy during training

**If both methods perform identically**:
- This could indicate the inner learning rate is too high/low
- Try adjusting `--inner_lr` (currently 0.01)
- Check that we're using the correct MAML implementation

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The experiment succeeds if it shows:
1. **Both methods start with good performance** (>55% at step 0)
2. **Both methods improve with adaptation** (reaching 65-75% after 10-20 steps)  
3. **Clear adaptation efficiency difference**: Second-Order reaches target accuracy in fewer steps
4. **Statistical significance**: Consistent pattern across all 5 seeds

This will provide **definitive empirical evidence** that Second-Order MAML adapts faster than First-Order MAML, which is the correct theoretical expectation for meta-learning methods.

## 🔬 Key Insight

This experiment design **correctly separates**:
- ✅ **Training efficiency**: How long to meta-train (already measured - Second-Order is slower)
- ✅ **Adaptation efficiency**: How quickly trained models adapt to new tasks (this experiment)

Previous experiments incorrectly conflated these two phases, leading to meaningless results where neither method learned anything.
